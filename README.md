my Game\_Of\_Life.js
=================
An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life implemented using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (or CoffeScript. Haven't decided yet.)

The libraries I'm going to be using to make this are:

+ [Raphaeljs 2.0.0](raphaeljs.com/reference.html) for Vector Graphics.
+ [JQuerry](jquery.com) for... well, JQuery.

Currently I'm also looking into using:

+ [Backbone.js](documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) for an MVC backbone. Though I'm leaning away from it for the experience of writing an MVC JavaScript app from sratch.
+ [Underscore.js](documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) as either a dependency for Backbone, or just because it looks _awesome_.
+ [Modernizr](modernizer.com) for legacy support. Though I'm probably going to just be developing for Chrome. Maybe Firefox.
+ [Dr. JS](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/dr.js) (Link? Is this really all there is wrt documentation?) for documenting the JS I write up.

This entire project is probably going to be very heavily based on the excellent pathfinding libray of Xueqiao Xu, [PathFinding.js](https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js).
