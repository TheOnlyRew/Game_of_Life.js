my Game\_Of\_Life.js
=================
An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life implemented using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (or CoffeScript. Haven't decided yet.)

The libraries I'm going to be using to make this are:
[Raphaeljs 2.0.0](raphaeljs.com) for Vector Graphics.
[JQuerry](jquery.com) for... well, JQuery.

Currently I'm also looking into using:
[Backbone.js](documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) for an MVC backbone. Though I'm leaning away from it for the experience of writing an MVC JavaScript app from sratch.
[Underscore.js](documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) as either a dependency for Backbone, or just because it looks _awesome_.
[Modernizr](modernizer.com) for legacy support. Though I'm probably going to just be developing for Chrome. Maybe Firefox.
