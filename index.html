        <p>This is my crack at a JavaScript-backed implementation of John Conway's ageless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life.</a></p>
        <ul>The rules---as much for my benefit as yours---are as follows: Every generation
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive</li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;
        <ul>The modes of interaction with this board are as follows:
            <li>Left-click any empty cell to make it alive</li>
            <li>Left-click any live cell to kill it off</li>
            <li>Left-click and drag anywhere on the board to move the view frustum</li>
            <li>TODO: Right-click movement. Mouse-wheel zooming.</li> 
        &nbsp;
        <p>It should be noted that the grid I've implemented is (theoretically) infinite, so any gliders you loose will just keep on going. This shouldn't be a problematic memory leak (assuming you don't stock up on Glider Guns) as the underlying model only tracks live cells. This does, however, suggest a rather inefficient implementation---it is a web-app, after all---so don't expect anything extraordinary.</p>
