        <p>This is my crack at a JavaScript-backed implementation of John Conway's ageless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life.</a></p>
        <ul>The rules---as much for my benefit as yours---are as follows: Every generation
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive</li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;
        <ul>The modes of interaction with this board are as follows:
          <li>Left-click any empty cell to make it alive</li>
          <li>Left-click any live cell to kill it off</li>
          <li>Left-click and drag anywhere on the board to move the view frustum</li>
          <li>TODO: Right-click movement. Mouse-wheel zooming.</li> 
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="tab_why" class="tab_content">
        <p>I've put this whole thing for my own edification. It was an experiment designed solely to glean a familiarity with CoffeeScript (and, as a result, JavaScript), HTML5 and CSS3. I wanted to do as much of the formatting---structure, typography, visual flare---in HTML and CSS less so that I can learn the old way of putting web pages together, but so that I know what to look for in the "right" way.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tab_how" class="tab_content">
        <p>Ahh fuck it. I'll add this content in when I have the structure fleshed out.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the grid I've implemented is (theoretically) infinite, so any gliders you loose will just keep on going. This shouldn't be a problematic memory leak (assuming you don't stock up on Glider Guns) as the underlying model only tracks live cells. This does, however, suggest a rather inefficient implementation---it is a web-app, after all---so don't expect anything extraordinary.</p>
